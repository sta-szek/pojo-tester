Java library for testing POJOs
===
`pojo-tester` is a Java POJO testing library, which makes your POJO tests much easier. You can test objects against `equals`, `hashCode`, `toString`, getters, setters and constructors.

This is a fork of the now defunct [pojo-tester](https://github.com/sta-szek/pojo-tester) project, by Piotr Jo≈Ñski.
